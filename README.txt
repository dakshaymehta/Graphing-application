To run this on windows: 

    For this to run on windows with the GUI, you would need a Xlaunch software, which can be easily downloaded
        - Xlaunch is required for the GUI part of this application
        - On windows, its required because its not a UNIX system, and MAC is. 

STEPS: 

    -Launch Xlaunch
    - Type this is in the terminal: export DISPLAY=:0
    - Find the file in the directory saved
    - run: python3/python APP_pre-Alpha.py 
    - pop up window, should appear, asking for the data file you want to use
    - choose that, and then it should continue



To run this on Linux/ MAC: 
-As these are UNIX based systems, you can just run the code wihtout needing any additional software to display the GUI.

STEPS:
    -go to your terminal and enter the directory where the code is saved
    - Then run : 
                    python3/python APP_Pre-Alpha.py 

    - The app should run, and from there it tell you what you need to do
    - pop up window, should appear, asking for the data file you want to use
    - choose that, and then it should continue
